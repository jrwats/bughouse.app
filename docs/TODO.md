Features:
 * Flesh out react-chessboard


Bugs:
* Challenges are parsed wrong (first name isn't necessarily white)
* On accepting partnership UI seems to "refresh" instead of just popup the newly
  formed partnership
* Partering lag
  * Offeror/Initiator has a log - implement "accepted"
    listener rather than relying on polling
